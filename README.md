Learning how to learn

## Background Context
The goal of this project is to write a simple UNIX command interpreter. It's an opportunity to apply your knowledge of C programming, understand how a shell works, and enhance your skills in team collaboration.

## Important Note from Julien
Julien emphasizes the importance of understanding the framework, not copying solutions, and learning how to walk toward the solution instead of memorizing it. Collaboration is encouraged, but both partners are responsible for the code pushed to GitHub. Cheating, plagiarism, and shortcuts are strongly discouraged.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain various concepts, including:

General history and details about the original Unix operating system
The design and implementation of the UNIX shell
Basics of the C programming language and its predecessor, B programming language
Knowledge about Ken Thompson
Understanding of how a shell works
Concepts like pid, ppid, system calls, and functions
Manipulating the environment of the current process
Execution of other programs with the execve system call
Handling the PATH to find programs
Suspension of process execution until a child terminates
Understanding EOF (end-of-file)

## Output
Program output must match sh (/bin/sh) for both normal and error output.
## Made for ALX SE Program



## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
